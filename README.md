# Dropdown Menu Project

This is a simple and responsive dropdown menu built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select an item from a list, and the button label updates to reflect the selected item. The dropdown also includes a visual caret and toggle behavior.

# Files

index.js – JavaScript functionality for toggling the dropdown and updating the button text.

# Features
